        <h2>Final Project: Ethics Essay</h2>
        <p>
            The culminating assignment for CST 300 was an ethics-based analytical essay addressing 
            the question: <em>Should technology companies be legally compelled to include encryption 
            backdoors in their products?</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This essay examined the ethical, legal, and technical implications of mandating encryption 
            backdoors for law enforcement access. The paper analyzed arguments related to national security, 
            individual privacy rights, cybersecurity risks, and corporate responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drawing from academic research, legal analysis, and industry case studies, the essay evaluated 
            competing perspectives on whether compelled access enhances public safety or undermines digital 
            security. Particular attention was given to the technical reality that introducing intentional 
            vulnerabilities can weaken systems for all users, not just targeted individuals.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Themes Explored</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The balance between privacy rights and national security interests</li>
            <li>The technical risks of creating intentional vulnerabilities in encryption systems</li>
            <li>The global implications of weakening cryptographic standards</li>
            <li>The ethical responsibility of technology companies to protect user data</li>
            <li>Precedents involving government access to encrypted communications</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The essay concluded that legally mandated encryption backdoors introduce systemic security 
            risks that outweigh potential investigative benefits. Strong encryption protects not only 
            individual privacy but also financial systems, critical infrastructure, and national security. 
            Compromising encryption standards may create broader vulnerabilities that could be exploited 
            by malicious actors.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills Developed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ethical analysis within computing contexts</li>
            <li>Structured argumentation and thesis development</li>
            <li>Evaluation of scholarly and policy-based sources</li>
            <li>Professional academic writing and revision</li>
            <li>Clear communication of complex technical concepts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            This project strengthened my ability to analyze controversial technology issues 
            through both ethical and technical lenses. It required careful consideration of 
            real-world trade-offs and reinforced the importance of evidence-based reasoning 
            in professional and academic communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            The experience improved my confidence in presenting complex computing topics in 
            a structured and persuasive format, an essential skill for leadership and 
            decision-making roles in technology.
