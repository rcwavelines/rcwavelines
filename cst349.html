            <h1>CST 349: Computer Science Proseminar</h1>

            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>
                The Proseminar course helps students prepare for life after college by connecting their major 
                to broader personal and professional goals. In this course, students critically analyze 
                information from diverse sources, including academic and business literature and conversations 
                with industry mentors. Students also develop crucial problem-solving, communication, and 
                teamwork skills throughout the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                This analysis and skill development guide students in crafting their personal value proposition 
                and a plan for developing a professional portfolio.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Junior Standing Required</p>
            <p><strong>Typically Offered:</strong> Fall, Spring</p>
            <p><strong>Units:</strong> 2</p>

            <h2>Industry Expert Interview Report</h2>
            <p>
                For this assignment, I interviewed a Senior Data Architect and Engineer who has worked extensively 
                within the Databricks ecosystem for over ten years. Their experience spans enterprise data platform 
                architecture, large-scale distributed systems, cloud infrastructure design, and advanced analytics 
                implementation.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>
                The professional began working with Apache Spark during its early adoption phase and transitioned 
                into building large-scale data engineering solutions using Databricks as it matured into an enterprise 
                analytics platform. Over the past decade, they have designed data lakes, implemented Delta Lake 
                architectures, optimized ETL pipelines, and led cross-functional engineering teams delivering 
                cloud-native data solutions.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Insights from the Interview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong fundamentals in distributed systems and data modeling are more important than platform-specific tools.</li>
                <li>Cloud architecture knowledge is essential for modern data engineering roles.</li>
                <li>Scalability and cost-efficiency must always be considered when designing data platforms.</li>
                <li>Communication between data engineers, analysts, and business stakeholders determines project success.</li>
                <li>Continuous learning is mandatory due to rapid innovation in the data and AI landscape.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Industry Perspective</h3>
            <p>
                The interview emphasized that the data engineering field has shifted from traditional database 
                administration toward scalable cloud-native architectures. Databricks, in particular, was described 
                as a platform that integrates engineering, analytics, and machine learning into a unified workflow. 
                The expert highlighted the importance of understanding not just how to use tools, but why certain 
                architectural decisions are made.
            </p>

            <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                This conversation reinforced the importance of building strong foundational knowledge in computer 
                science while remaining adaptable to evolving technologies. Hearing firsthand how large-scale 
                distributed systems are implemented in production environments clarified the skills I need to 
                prioritize: system design, data structures, cloud computing, and collaborative problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interview also helped me better define my professional direction by demonstrating how technical 
                depth combined with communication and leadership skills can create long-term career growth. This 
                experience strengthened my understanding of how to position myself within the technology industry 
                and how to continue building a portfolio aligned with modern data engineering practices.
            </p>
